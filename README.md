# miTribute
This was a personal learning project that I undertook in order to have a practical exercise to develop my Javascript skills in addition to my interest in game development.  Using one of my favorite games as inspiration and groundwork allowed me to focus entirely on research, learning, and developing the engine. 

Although the game can not run locally (because it loads models as json files that require being online), you can visit it hosted on my site at casesilva.com/monkeyIslandTribute.html to see it in its current state.  As of now, you can look at the characters and speak to the pirate with the red jacket.
